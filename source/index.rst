The spectra-cluster toolsuite provides tools to facilitate the usage of
spectrum clustering for MS/MS based proteomics data analysis.

It is centered around our spectra-cluster algorithm which is used to build
the `PRIDE Cluster`_ resource (`Griss et al., Nat. Methods 2016`_) and can process up to 100+ million MS/MS spectra.

Getting started
===============

The simplest way to use the spectra-cluster algorithm is through our newly released `Proteome Discoverer Node`_.

For a step-by-step instruction have a look at our :doc:`/tutorials/proteome_discoverer`.
